## About

This repository contains two sub-folders , one is "using NN" and other is "using CNN"
<ol>
  <li> The "using NN" contains code for digit recognition using Neural Networks from scratch and MNIST Digit dataset is used.
  <li> The "using CNN" contains two codes:
     <ol>
     <li> One is for recognition using Convolution Neural Networks with Tensorflow on the CIFAR 10 dataset.
     <li> One is for digit recognition on MNIST dataset using CNN with Tensorflow.
     </ol>
